# Single Person Tracking with Occlusion using Kalman Filter



## Description

This project aims to create a system for tracking a single person using cameras, combining YOLOv8 for detection and a Kalman filter for enhanced tracking accuracy, especially during periods of poor visibility or detection failure.
